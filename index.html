                <h3><b>Today, we talk to Tiwa, a 58-year-old woman who reversed her diabetes. She tells us how...</b></h3>
                <p>
                    "Hello, this is Tiwa,
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2009, shortly after my husband's death, I got diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I checked in for a test, the doctor said my blood sugar is 265mg/dL.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From what he said, taking a few medicines he was going to prescribe will help me delay the severity of the disease
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because it's a long term disease that just never goes.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    <b>
                        Although I was heartbroken, the deed was done and I had to do what the doctor told me to live a near-normal life.
                    </b>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Right there, on that spot, he brought out his pen and jotted down, in his poor handwriting, a list of drugs I should get in a pharmacy as soon as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He also advised that I stop eating some foods totally and exercise my body a lot more often.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I never knew that day was what would start a long journey of horror in my life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What started as a simple list of drugs kept increasing until I was spending over ₦120,000 every month to handle my type 2 diabetes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would visit a doctor at least 4 times every month and the one thing they recommended was that I stop eating carbohydrates, exercise harder and keep taking my drugs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was buying everything they recommended. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yet, my condition wasn't improving.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was piling on body fat around my belly and waist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I couldn't do simple house chores without breathing heavily like someone climbing a mountain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was getting further and further apart from the woman I was while my husband was still alive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And I felt exhausted every time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My children had to help me with everything.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They're my only motivation to keep moving.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I didn't want someone else to take my motherly responsibility on them.
                </p>
                <p>I was really, really getting worse everyday.</p>
                <p>
                    After trying out everything and almost giving up, <b>a very good friend sent me a video</b>. She told me that diabetes could be stopped naturally.
                </p>


                <p>
                    Of course I was skeptical… If it was true, why hadn't my doctor told me about it?
                </p>
                <p>
                    But after all, I had nothing to lose so I watched this video.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And I must say I was very surprised!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Inside, I learned that a Nigerian doctor, who is based in India, had found a natural and effective way to normalize blood sugar levels, using what he calls "The Diabetes Destroyer".
                </p>
                <p>
                    And his patients manage to get rid of their diabetes, in almost 100% of the cases.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So I followed the recommendations of this video, without much hope I must admit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the first days, I didn't see much change, but I decided to continue anyway.
                </p>

              

                <p>
                    I almost gave up after 3 weeks passed without any noticeable difference!
                </p>
                <p>
                    But I held on to a mustard seed sized faith and kept at it because many of his patients said they didn't have good results until the sixth week too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, on the very fourth week, things started happening fast!
                </p>
                <p>
                    My blood sugar was down 69 points from 480 I recorded the previous day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I didn't exercise at all but it still reduced anyway.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I know it sounds like magic to you just as it looked to me too that day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before the end of the week, I was recording a little bit over 200mg/dL.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second month, I had a routine appointment with my doctor. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well, he was "extremely surprised" (his words) by my blood sugar numbers. I was at 103 when I went to see him, at 9:30am in the morning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since then, I'm alive again. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The layers of fat below my belly were closing up at an alarming rate…
                </p>
                <p>
                    I could literally see the difference myself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was getting more active and I feel like I could get more things done during the day…
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every day I thank God, and especially my friend, for sending me this video."Want to know more?
